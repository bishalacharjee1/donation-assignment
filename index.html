        <h1 id="black">Our Monthly <span>Programs</span></h1>
        <p id="C">A monthly giving program is a recurring donation program where donors can automatically <br> donate a specific amount to their favorite nonprofit organization on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. <br> Such regular donation plans help nonprofits generate a steady stream of financial support <br> so that they can fulfill their vision and mission more effectively.</p>

        <div class="flex-container">
            <div id="c1" class="item">
                <h3>More Funds </h3>
                <img id="images" src="image/d-1.png" alt="">
                <p>The average monthly online donation is $52 ($624 per year) compared to the average one-time gift of $128.The average recurring donor will give 42% more in one year than those who give one-time gifts.This shows that great monthly giving programs have a much higher return on investment compared to one-time giving programs.</p>

                <h3>Higher Retention Rate</h3>
                <img id="images" src="image/d-2.png" alt="">
                <p>Monthly donors have a higher retention rate than other types of donors. New donor retention rates average less than 23%. Monthly giving programs typically enjoy retention rates over 80% after one year and 95% after five years.</p>

                <h3>Easy for Donors</h3>
                <img id="images" src="image/d-3.png" alt="">
                <p>Monthly giving programs are not only relatively simple to manage for nonprofits, but they also make giving easy for donors. Donors sign up once, and their gifts are made automatically and at a frequency of their choosing, giving them flexibility and convenience. </p>

            <p>If you don’t have clear goals in mind for your recurring giving program, <br> it’s going to be challenging to understand what you need to do to reach your target. <br> It also makes it more difficult for your donors to understand how they fit into the big picture. <br> <br>
                With your team, work to answer these questions: <br> <br>              
                . What do we want to accomplish through monthly giving? <br>
                . How does monthly giving contribute to our programs and mission? <br>
                . What would happen as a result of achieving our goal?</p> <br> <br>
